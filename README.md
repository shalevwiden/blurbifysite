# Blurbify site

### Oct 18

So far its a web based version with no python pillow or frame functionality.
It does the job.

I am creating a mobile responsive site so I can use it from my phone too.

Inputs to change the username, name, text content, and pfp without writing any code (user friendly)

Next I need to add google analytics tracking

Fuk it I wanna make this a site other people can use. Get a lil bit of users lol.
