# Blurbify

This is code that will create little tweet like headings and stuff.
The idea is to use pillow.

I also need to create a website for this, blurbify.com

Use the dolphinoverlay.py as reference in pdf templates

### Future Libraries

CairoSVG
Pillow
OpenCV

Inkscape CLI

Right now I'm using OOP for the template but in the future I want to use JSON

So now I'm thinking to use HTML and CSS fully for the project which does make more sense. I can still add stuff on top of the saved HTML and CSS though WITH pillow.

New plan is use an automation to open up the browser and take a bunch of screenshots.
I wonder what the lag time will be tho...

### Oct 14, 2025

An HTML and CSS version has finally been completed lets goo

In the future:

- Make it a Jinja template
- have it for different channels of mine, like Motionline Animations
