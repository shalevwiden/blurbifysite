# Blurbify site

### Oct 18

So far its a web based version with no python pillow or frame functionality.
It does the job.

I am creating a mobile responsive site so I can use it from my phone too.

Inputs to change the username, name, text content, and pfp without writing any code (user friendly)

Next I need to add google analytics tracking

It is deployed on Vercel at [this link](https://blurbifysite.vercel.app/)

Docs may be limited, but I should have a bunch of linkedin posts explaining the technicalities behind this stuff.

### Nov 5, 2025

I need to write a lot of docs for this
Because theres a lot of technicalities.
Using the 450px media quiery breakpoint for phone size stuff.

The profile picture sizing is tricky since theres a preview div.
The .adjustmentsdiv
But since the pfp is smaller it needs to be adjusted proportionally.

Need to add templates.
And user accounts for sure.

### Adding Navbar

For SCSS, the underscore \_ tells scss not to compile it directly

### Nov 14

Making a Jinja template now
In the future with React I'll have to pivot.
